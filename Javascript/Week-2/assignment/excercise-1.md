Manipulating an array
Take the following array:


const theList = ['Laurence', 'Svekis', true, 35, null, undefined,
{test: 'one', score: 55}, ['one', 'two']];


Manipulate your array using various methods, such as pop(), push(), shift(), and
unshift(), and transform it into the following:

["FIRST", "Svekis", "MIDDLE", "hello World", "LAST"]


You can take the following steps, or adopt your own approach:
• Remove the first item and the last item.
• Add FIRST to the start of the array.
• Assign hello World to the fourth item value.
• Assign MIDDLE to the third index value.
• Add LAST to the last position in the array.
• Output it to the console.
